# VirtualPianoBot
A virtual piano player, that you can train to play different songs, as well as the built-in songs.


How to use:

  1. Ensure you have python installed (Python 3.8 recommended)
     
     If you don't have python, get it at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/
     
  2. Go into your terminal and execute these following commands
  
     `cd downloads` OR `cd Downloads`
     
     `git clone https://github.com/azh412/VirtualPianoBot.git`
     
     `pip3 install pyautogui`
     
  3. To run the bot, execute `python3 VirtualPianoBot` 
  
     Then, choose a song name based on the txt files in the new folder in Downloads
     
     Lastly, very quickly switch to the window you want to play the piano on, and wait until the song is finished!
